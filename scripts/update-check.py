"""Check what Frametop needs from SteamOS, for after a SteamOS update.

On the Frame, a SteamOS update replaces SteamVR, KWin, gamescope, and the kernel along with
the rest of the OS image. Frametop lives in the home folder and survives it, but it uses
SteamVR and KWin interfaces that an update can change or drop, some of them undocumented.
This checks each one, and compares the versions with the last ones recorded as working.

  scripts/update-check.py              # check (scripts/doctor.sh runs this)
  scripts/update-check.py --mark-good  # check, then record these versions as working

From a PC: ssh frame python3 - [--mark-good] < scripts/update-check.py

It only reads. It connects to SteamVR as a background app (which never starts SteamVR),
runs `vrcmd --overlays` as the pointer helper does, maps the eye tracker's shared memory
read-only, and follows a controller on vrserver's web socket for a moment. It never starts,
stops, or restarts anything.
